<h1>Element components (i.e. buttons)</h1>
<p>
    These components should be rendered for W3.CSS style sheet. Some component test transforms 
    for example CSS-classes, so these will probably look weird.

require_once("../vendor/autoload.php");

use UUP\Web\Component\Element\Button;

$button = new Button("Button1");
$button->render();

$button = new Button("Button2", array(
